Requestly Network Inspector lets you debug network requests from various apps in a single place.

You can see all the network requests initiated by the browser and the corresponding responses from the web server. Use this information to debug issues related to network requests, such as slow loading times, missing resources, or failed requests. This includes information such as:

* URL of the requested resource

- HTTP method (e.g. GET, POST, etc.) used for the request

* Request and response headers

- Request and response payloads

* HTTP status code of the response
