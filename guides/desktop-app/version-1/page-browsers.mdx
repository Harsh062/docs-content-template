2. This will open a popup modal which consists all detected browsers on your system, along with other sources that Requestly supports. Select the browser that you want to launch.

**Preset Configurations**

* `Without Safety Checks`: This sets the following flags:

  `--allow-running-insecure-content --allow-insecure-localhost --allow-third-party-modules`

- `Without CORS`: This launches the browser with `--disable-web-securtiy` flag set

- `With Custom Arguments`: This allows you to specify your own custom launch arguments. Currently this is only supported for chromium based browsers. You can find a comprehensive list of arguments [here](https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/)
