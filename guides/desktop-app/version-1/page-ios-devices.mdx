   To ensure that the proxy has been set, visit [http://amiusing.requestly.io](http://amiusing.requestly.io/) . If the rendered page shows success as follows, means the proxy is now correctly configured.

## 2. Install CA Certificate

### a. Download the SSL certificate as a custom profile

1. Now open Safari on your IOS device and go to [http://requestly.io/ssl](https://requestly.io/ssl)**(remember to use HTTP, not HTTPS)**.

2) This should download a custom profile on your device which contains the Requestly CA certificate..

### b. Install custom iOS profile

1. Now to install the downloaded custom profile go to Settings. You should see a new option at the top that says Profile Downloaded. Select that to install the profile

2. Click on Install. This will also ask you to enter your pin/passphrase. Once everything is complete, click Done on the top right to finish the installation and navigate out

3. Install the new custom iOS profile

### c. Enable trust for SSL certificate

1. Finally, you need to enable trust for CA certificates that were installed along with this custom profile. Go to `Settings -> General -> About -> Certificate Trust Settings`

# Reverting the setup

Remember to disable the HTTP Proxy in your Settings when you stop using Requestly, otherwise, you'll get confusing network failures in your applications! You just need to set the network proxy the next time you want to debug with Requestly.
