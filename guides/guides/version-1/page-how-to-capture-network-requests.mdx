There are many different ways to capture network depending on what you are trying to achieve

1. You can record a web session which records everything that you did on the web page - Page interactions + network logs + console logs. These are mainly used for reporting a bug within your team. You can learn more about how to just extract network logs from [this article](https://requestly.com/blog/how-to-download-network-logs-using-requestly-sessionbook/)

2. If you use the desktop app, it provides a complete traffic table from where you can inspect, filter, save logs and even apply rules directly from this table. You can learn more about that by just [trying out the desktop a](https://requestly.com/downloads/desktop/)[pp or reading the document](https://requestly.com/downloads/desktop/)[ati](https://docs.requestly.com/desktop-app/traffic-inspector)[on.](https://docs.requestly.com/desktop-app/traffic-inspector)

3. We are currently working on a way to bring all the capabilities of the desktop app to the web. We are very close to releasing it, you can follow the progress for it by subscribing to [this issue on Gi](https://github.com/requestly/requestly/issues/1901)thub

4. Apart from these, when you install the extension it also adds our advanced devtools pannel next to the chrome devtools. It is very easy to modify requests by creating rules directly from there.
