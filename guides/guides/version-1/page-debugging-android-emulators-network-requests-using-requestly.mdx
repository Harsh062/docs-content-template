# What is it?

Just like your desktop web browser has a Network Devtool panel that lets you have granular control over your Network requests. Requestly offers a similar debugging experience for Android Emulators.

The `Android Emulator Network Debugger` in Requestly, you can simulate different network conditions, tweak requests on the fly, and share the results easily—essentially providing a powerful extension to your development toolkit.
