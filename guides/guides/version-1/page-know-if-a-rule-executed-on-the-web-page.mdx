Once you have enabled a Requestly rule to modify some part of a network request or the page, next thing you would like to do is to confirm if the rule executed successfully.

Here are multiple ways to know if a rule executed on a page.

### Extension icon turns green

If any of the rules executes on the current page, the Requestly icon in the extension toolbar (next to the address bar) will turn from a normal icon to a green icon.

### Executed rules tab in popup

1. Open the extension popup by clicking on the Requestly icon in the extension toolbar.

2) Switch to *Executed rules* tab.

All the rules which executed in the current page will be listed in this tab.

### Logs in browser console

Whenever a rule is applied, Requestly can print a log in browser console mentioning:

* details of the intercepted network request

- name of rule which was applied

To enable, toggle ON the setting **Enable console logs** from [https://app.requestly.io/settings](https://app.requestly.io/settings).

To open browser console logs:

1. Right-click on the page and select *Inspect*.

2) Switch to *Console* tab.

### Requestly devtool

1. Right-click on the page and select *Inspect*.

2) Switch to *Requestly* tab.

3. Reload the page.

It should list all intercepted network requested which were modified by Requestly, alongwith the link to rule and the summary of modification.

> ***Note***\*: Unless the page is reloaded with the devtool opened, it cannot capture the network requests. This is a browser limitation.\*

### Rule execution logs

You may also check the execution logs for a rule individually.

1. Go to [Requestly app](https://app.requestly.io/rules/) and open the rule.

2) In the footer, click **Execution Logs** tab.

It should list all the network requests modified by this rule.
