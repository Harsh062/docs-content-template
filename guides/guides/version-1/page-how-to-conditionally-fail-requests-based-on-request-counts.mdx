Mock an API response to fail on the first try and succeed on the second attempt. This can be easily done using shared state.

> Note: `$sharedState` is only available in extension version > `24.8.13` and desktop app > `v1.7.1`

### Steps to conditionally fail requests are:

1. Create a new [modify response rule](https://docs.requestly.com/general/http-rules-\(modify-traffic\)/http-rules--rule-types/modify-response-body)

2. Select dynamic javascript modification

3. Write javascript code to conditionally fail requests based on request counts

   ```javascript
   function modifyResponse(args) {
     const {method, url, response, responseType, requestHeaders, requestData, responseJSON} = args;
     // Change response below depending upon request attributes received in args
     let count=$sharedState.count ?? 0;
     ++count;
     $sharedState.count=count;

     // Succeed if it is not the first request
     if($sharedState.count>0){
       return response;
     } else {
       return null;
     }
   }
   ```
