### Sharing options

2) **Anyone with the link**: select if you want the recording to be accessed by anyone on the internet.

3. **All members of my organization** - select if you want the recording to be accessed by anyone in your organization. *The support for this option is coming soon...*

4) **Only with specific people** - select if you want only specific people to access it. For recordings inside workspaces, it will also be visible to members of the workspace
