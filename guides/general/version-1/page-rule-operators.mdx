### Equals Operator

Equals operator does strict matching of URL intercepted by the browser with the URL given in rule.

#### Example

> URL given in rule: http\://www\.google.com Intercepted URL: [http://www.google.com/](http://www.google.com/) (*Observe trailing slash*) Result: ❌ Does not match

#### Reason

Note a trailing `/` slash at the end of URL. A rule with `Equals` operator and URL as [www.example.com](http://www.example.com/) **does not** match [www.example.com/](http://www.example.com/). You may consider adding Slash (`/`) at the end of URL in your rule. You can alternatively create two pairs in the same rule as well.

### Contains Operator

Contains operator does a substring search of string provided in rule inside the URL intercepted by chrome.

#### Example 1

> String in rule: yahoo Intercepted URL: [https://www.yahoo.com/](https://www.yahoo.com/) Result: ✅ Match

#### Example 2

> String in rule: com?a=1 Intercepted URL: [https://www.got.com?a=2](https://www.got.com/?a=2) Result: ❌ Does not match

#### Reason

`com?a=1` is not a substring of a URL and hence it does not match.

### RegEx Match Operator

Regex Match Operator matches a given Regex with the URL intercepted by chrome.

You can also use the values of **group expressions in your destination URLs**.

#### Example

> URL Matches (Regex): /(.+).google/ig Destination: https\://$1.google.com Result: ✅ Match

#### Reason

In this case, above regex will be matched with intercepted URL. If regex is matched then $1 will be replaced in the destination URL and redirect will happen.

### Wildcard Match Operator

Wildcard match operator matches expression with the URL intercepted by chrome.

We only support asterisk (`*`) as wildcard operator. `*` can match **0 or more characters** in intercepted url.

💡

Caution In wildcard match, complete URL is matched with given expression and `\*` can be replaced with respective values in destination URL.

#### Example 1

> Expression: *://*.yahoo.com URL: [http://cricket.yahoo.com](http://cricket.yahoo.com/) Result: $1 = http, $2 = cricket

#### Example 2

> Expression: \*yahoo URL: [http://www.yahoo.com](http://www.yahoo.com/) (*Note the trails does not match ie *`.com`) Result: ❌ Does not match

#### Example 3

> Expression: *yahoo* URL: [http://www.yahoo.com](http://www.yahoo.com/) Result: $1 = [http://www.](http://www./) $2=.com

#### Example 4

> Expression: http\://\*.yahoo.com URL: [http://cricket.yahoo.com/](http://cricket.yahoo.com/) (*Note the trailing *`/`* slash in URL*) Result: ❌ Does not match
