`$sharedState` allows you to store and retrieve data within and across [Modify Request](https://docs.requestly.com/general/http-rules-\(modify-traffic\)/rule-types/modify-request-body) and [Modify Response](https://docs.requestly.com/general/http-rules-\(modify-traffic\)/http-rules--rule-types/modify-response-body) rules. It is a javascript Object where you can assign key-value pairs from different requests and use it in your rules.

## Use cases

1. Conditional request/response modification based on some conditions stored in previous requests. Please read [here](https://docs.requestly.com/guides/how-to-conditionally-fail-requests-based-on-request-counts) about how you can conditionally fail requests based on the requests counts.

2. Aggregate data from multiple requests to be used in a rule.

3. Manage tokens or values across different API requests.

## How to use?

1. Create a new [modify response rule](https://docs.requestly.com/general/http-rules-\(modify-traffic\)/http-rules--rule-types/modify-response-body) or [modify request rule](https://docs.requestly.com/general/http-rules-\(modify-traffic\)/rule-types/modify-request-body)

2. Select dynamic javascript modification

3. You can use the `$sharedState` variable to manage and share state

   1. Using `$sharedState` to store data

      ```javascript
      function modifyResponse(args) {
        const {method, url, response, responseType, requestHeaders, requestData, responseJSON} = args;
        
        // Stores all Request URLs and their response
        const URLMap=$sharedState.urlMap;
        URLMap[url]=response;
        $sharedState.urlMap=urlMap;
        
        return response;
      }
      ```

   2. Using `$sharedState` to dynamically modify the response

      ```javascript
      function modifyResponse(args) {
        const {method, url, response, responseType, requestHeaders, requestData, responseJSON} = args;
        
        // Checks if requestURL: https://api.ex.com/postData was fired 
        // then fail all the subsequent requests
        if("https://api.ex.com/postData" in $sharedState.urlMap){
      	  return null;
        }
        
        return response;
      }
      ```

## FAQs

1. How do I access the sharedState?\
   You can use the following code in the dynamic javascript editor:

   ```javascript
   // To set a value in the sharedState
   $sharedState.myVariable = "some value";

   // To retrieve a value from the sharedState
   let myValue = $sharedState.myVariable;
   ```

2. What data can I store in the sharedState?\
   The sharedState can store any kind of data that can be serialized to JSON, including strings, numbers, booleans, objects, and arrays.

3. How long does the data in the sharedState persist?\
   `$sharedState` has different runtime context in the Requestly desktop app and Requestly browser extension.

   1. **Desktop App**: It persists until the desktop app is closed.

   2. **Browser Extension**: It runs in the context of a browser tab. It persists until the tab is closed.
