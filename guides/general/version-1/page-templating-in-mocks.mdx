Our methods support handlebars like templating (`{{}}` )along with the following special methods to make your responses dynamic

1. `urlParams`

   You can define parameters inside the mock endpoint using a colon (`:`).

   For example - the endpoint `/book/:id` defines the `id` parameter that can be used inside the body of your mocks as `{{urlParams id}}`

2. `header`

   The value of any of the request headers can be dynamically rendered into your response using this method.

   For example - the string `{{header content-type}}` renders the value of the content-type header

3. `method` : You can add the request method to your mock's response body by including `{{method}}` in your mock response

4. `statusCode` : Renders the original status code inside the template

Let us know if you have ideas for other templating methods that you might need.
