The Map Remote feature lets you change the request's location to a new destination location such that the response is transparently served from the new location as if it was the original request.

### How to use

You can use Redirect/Replace rule to set up mappings.

* [Redirect rule](https://developers.requestly.com/http-rules/map-local-url-redirect/) allows you to redirect network requests from one URL to another.

- [Replace rule](https://developers.requestly.com/http-rules/replace-strings/) allows you to replace a part of the URL with another string.

You can check out the demo here:

### Matching Requests

All the Requestly rules can match requests based on the URL, host, path, and [rule operators](https://docs.requestly.io/browser-extension/chrome/features/rule-operators). With the help of these operators, you can define rules to match using the wildcard, regex, or string matching types. You can also perform [advanced targeting](https://developers.requestly.com/http-rules/advance-targeting/) on the requests.

You can perform regex pattern matching in replace rule to extract information from the URL:

For example: Extract domain, pathName and extension for URLs ending with `.jpg`

```bash
/(https:\/\/[^\/]*)(.+)(\.jpg)$/i
```

* $1 is the value of 1st group expression. – DomainName

- $2 is the value of the 2nd group expression – PathName but not the file extension

* $3 is the value of the 3rd group expression – File extension `.jpg` in this case

### Popular Use Cases

* Use development/staging endpoints on your production sites without changing the code so that you can directly test your local code on production sites without deployment.

- You can switch your domain to a local environment for testing new changes that are yet to be deployed.

* You can map HTTP requests to an HTTPS destination and vice versa.

- You can test the backward compatibility of a new API by mapping all requests to the more recent version of the API.
