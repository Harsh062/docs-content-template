Once you have saved a mock API, you may test it in Requestly API Client and see if the received response matches your expectation.

### Steps

1. Open the mock API from the list of mocks.

2) On top header, click the **Test** button.

   It opens a dialog with the endpoint URL field and request method already populated in UI.

3. Click **Send** button to see the response body and headers received from the mock API.

This confirms that the mock API is working as expected and can be used in your UI application.
