At some point, you would want to share the rules you have created with your colleagues and other developers. You can share your rules with colleagues and friends by **sharing rules within team workspaces** and using **Shared Lists** so that they don't have to create them again.

### Share rules within workspaces

You can share rules from one workspace to another workspace so that everyone is using the same set of rules also editing the rules in realtime in one workspace, and those changes will be reflected for all the users in workspaces.

💡

**TIP** Team Workspace lets you actively collaborate with your team without worrying about sharing the updated rule. [Learn More about Team Workspace→](https://developers.requestly.com/workspace/overview/)

To share rules in workspaces:

1. Go to[ My Rules](https://app.requestly.io/rules/my-rules) page.

2) Select one or more rules you want to share.

3. Click on `Share` button in the toolbar above rules table.

 

A share modal will popup, under **Share in workspace** tab you can take these following actions:

* Share rules from one workspace to another by clicking on `transfer here`** **for the workspace where you want the rules to be shared.
