The Requestly API endpoints let you integrate Requestly into your CI/CD Pipelines. It allows you to create and work with your rules.

* You can add, update, delete, and read rules with the API.

- Programmatically access data stored in your Requestly account

* Integrate Requestly with your CI/CD workflow.

#### Example use case

* Easily test changes related to a PR without needing a staging environment

* Automatically create staging JS bundles on PR creation followed by creating a Requestly Rule programmatically using Requestly API in a team workspace. The user can then name the rule depending on their PR name.

### Getting Started

You will need an `API key` for accessing the endpoints. Each api key is associated to a specific workspace and cannot be used to access the rules of another workspace.
