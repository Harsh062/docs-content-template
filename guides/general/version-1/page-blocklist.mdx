## Why Blocklist?

* In case the site contains sensitive information and you do not want Requestly to modify it in any way.

* If Requestly breaks a website somehow. (In case this happens - Please log an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/requestly/requestly/issues/new/choose) and we'll try to fix it ASAP 😅🤝)

## How to Add Sites to Blocklist

1. Go to [Settings](https://app.requestly.io/settings/global-settings) in Requestly App.

2. Go to `Blocked Sites` section and you can `website/domain` here.

   > Adding a domain will include all its subdomains. Eg "example.com" will block
   >
   > `a.example.com`, `b.example.com` , `c.b.example.com` ...
