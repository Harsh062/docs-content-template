The Source filter has 3 ways of advanced targeting methods to modify network requests:

* Page URL

First you can select page URL on which you want to add source filter. There are 4 ways to add your page URL of the site on which you want to apply this filter.

It let's you apply your rule to a particular website instead of all the websites you open in your browser. In the select drop-down you will see 4 options. below is described how you can use them.

### Page URL Targeting

Page URL based targeting allows developers to restrict requestly rules to be applied when the request URL originates from within the targeted page URL (or domain) only. There are 4 ways to add your page URL of the site on that you want to apply this filter: `Equals`, `Contains`, `Matches (Regex)`, and `Matches (Wildcard)`.

> EXAMPLE If you want to block a particular GET Request going from the desired site you can do it from here.

### Request Payload Targeting

Currently, Request Payload is available only for Response modification rules. It allows you to target a request based on the data that is sent along with it.

In case of a GET request, the data would be matched from the search parameters (a.k.a. query string). In a POST request, the request body will be used for targeting (currently supports only JSON data).

You can use JSON-like syntax for targeting as shown below:
