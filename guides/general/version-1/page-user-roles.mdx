Every workspace member can have one of these two roles:

### 1. Member

A member can work collaboratively with other members inside a workspace. So a workspace member can create and update rules, mock servers and session recordings inside that workspace.

### 2. Admin

An admin has all the capabilities of a member and can additionally manage the workspace's data, update information, and exclusively generate public invite links for new members. They also have the privilege to remove members from the workspace.
