## Endpoints

The current APIs give all the basic crud capabilities for rules. In case you want to quickly try these out on this playground [https://requestly.readme.io/](https://requestly.readme.io/)

### Get rules

You have the option to either get all the rules or get a certain

#### Get all rules

To retrieve all the rules, use the following endpoint.

**Endpoint**: `GET /rules`

**CURL Example**:

```bash
curl -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" https://api2.requestly.io/v1/rules
```

**Sample Response**:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "Redirect_fohh4",
      "name": "Sample Redirect Rule",
      "description": "This rule redirects example.com to newexample.com",
      "status": "Active",
      "ruleType": "Redirect",
      "pairs": [
        {
          "source": {
            "key": "Url",
            "operator": "Equals",
            "value": "<https://example.com>"
          },
          "destinationType": "url",
          "destination": "<https://newexample.com>"
        }
      ]
    },
    // ... other rules
  ],
  "total": 56,
  "nextOffset": 31,
}
```

This endpoint supports pagination. If the `nextOffset` in the response is `null` there are no more records to fetch.

You can specify which page of results to fetch by using the following query parameters in your request:

* `offset` : The index from where the results should start. Usually you will set this to the value you receive inside the `nextOffset`

* `pageSize` : Number of results you want to GET. By default this is set to `30` and can take a maximum value of `75` right now.

To retrieve a specific rule, use the rule's unique ID.
